RoboRIO 2015.
RoboRIO 2015. Hello whoever this may concern.

This is the 2015 Team 1672 FRC Robot Code. This code was authored by Andrew Chan (theandrewchan) and Jacob Davis (Jacob-Davis).

For this code, we have created a mecanum drive. This is for mecanum wheels. If these are going to be used, they need to be arranged in an "x" pattern with the angles facing towards the center of the robot. Also, the lift is monitored using an ultrasonic sensor. This code is used to set the lift to estimated heights determined by the heights of the totes and the containers.

To run this code...

Compile the code and check for build errors.
Run the Rio Tool to send code to the roboRio.
Open the 2015 Driver Station.
Connect the Joysticks.
Set the wireless DAP (Bridge) to 5-ghz mode.
Power on the Robot.
Run /Connect to robot WIFI/ As administrator in the desktop.
Connect to the wireless DAP via the wireless card in the laptop. The DAP should be named Team1672. The password: Team1672.
Go back to driver station. Wait for Robot Code and Robot Communication to turn green.
Enable robot in the mode of choice.
If any of these steps do not work, test the recent FRC software pack for updates. Or, check to see if any connections on the rio are incorrect.
